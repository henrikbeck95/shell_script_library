# Shell Script Library

Shell script functions collection for abstracting development process, speed up the productivity and clear the source code to be more human.

## Description

Do you have any idea how much time have you ever been wasting trying to solve "little" hard problems such as replacing text from a specific file, calculating math equations, auto unpacking files according their extensions, or even filtering the package manager according to the users operating system to guaranty the dependencies will be installed to run your script properly?

Now how about writing all the same "micro" solutions you have developed in each shell script file you write...!? This sounds like a nightmare, specially in Shell Script whose this programming language can automatize all of your operating system for good or for bad depending on how much your source code filters are robust to avoid problems or redundancies.

Do have have any idea how much commentaries your could remove from your source code because they can be replaced by abstractions with full commands descriptions on their names whose do what they should do!?

Now how about writing your scripts clear than before, specially in long shell script files!?

That's what **Shell Script Library** proposes to be done. One library, a powerful collection of functionalities and a clear source code. All of this by import one single file. **\o/ Wow! \o/**

Now think about when your have to use Shell Script commands inside your favorite programming language such as Java, JavaScript, Python and so on. Sometimes for a specific reason you have to implement a complex functionality to solve your problem. This may sounds another trouble to you because you need to learn Shell Script, isn't it!?

And how about packing the **Shell Script Library** to your project and import it when required without needing to writing shell scripts!? Would it be useful for you or for your project team? You're welcome.

So, focus your time developing what needs to be done by using the abstractions from this library. Because the source code workflow is more important than solving a lot of "little" hard problems whose have already been solved by us. Or in a specific case, you can consult the **Shell Script Library** source code and copy the function you need manually to your project.

- Just one advice:
    > Consider migrating your scripts to use this library.
